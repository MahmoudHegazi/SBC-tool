          <h3 class='post-header'>Portland Police Association leader explains why all members of Portland police riot squad resigned</h3>
          <p class='post-number-1'>Talia Kaplan Sun, June 20, 2021, 10:30 PM Portland Police Association Executive Director Daryl Turner argued on "Fox News Live" Sunday that elected officials "encouraged and enabled some of the violence'" that was taking place over the more than 150 nights of riots in Portland, explaining part of the reason why all 50 members of the Portland police riot squad known as the Rapid Response Team (RRT) resigned. A Portland Police Bureau (PPB) statement indicated that the resignations were effective as of last Wednesday, and it's unclear what implications would be for law enforcement response to future demonstrations in Portland, although Turner stressed that the officers have resigned from their voluntary positions on the Rapid Response Team, but will "still be doing the same job" and will "be ordered to do the same job, just a little bit different." Portland Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis had said that the police department will make sure that there are "as close to adequate resources as we can get within just the limits that we have to deal with anything that comes up with on-duty resources." All of the members of the Portland Police Bureau’s highly trained rapid response unit, which had responded to riots, resigned last week after the recent indictment of Officer Corey Budworth for allegedly assaulting a photographer during an overnight riot last summer. On Tuesday, a Multnomah County grand jury charged Budworth with one count of fourth-degree assault related to the Aug. 18, 2020, incident. That night, according to the Portland Police Association, about 200 demonstrators, many equipped with tactical helmets, face coverings, and armed with a variety of weapons, descended on the Multnomah Building in southeast Portland. Multiple dumpsters were set on fire, buildings were defaced, and windows were broken. A riot was declared at the planned event after someone from the crowd launched a Molotov cocktail into the building and set it ablaze. "After nearly 75 consecutive nights of violence, destruction, and mayhem, a small group of RRT (Rapid Response Team) officers — including Officer Budworth — were again tasked with dealing with the riot," the Portland Police Association said. "Per PPB Command Staff orders, RRT officers cleared the rioters from the area to allow the Fire Bureau to extinguish the blaze. But the rioters were not satisfied."

          <h3 class='post-header'>2022 Toyota Tundra officially revealed in full after internet leak</h3>
          <p class='post-number-2'>Gary Gastelu Mon, June 21, 2021, 3:03 AM If you can't beat them… After images of the upcoming all-new 2022 Toyota Tundra pickup were leaked on the internet by an anonymous source months ahead of its scheduled unveiling in September, Toyota has released an official photo of the full-size truck. The white four-door depicts the redesigned Tundra in its TRD Pro high performance off-road trim. The truck's most distinguishing feature is an enormous grille with LED light strips in that's highlighted in the photo by the vehicle's black and white color scheme. Toyota has promised that the new Tundra "will blow you away" and said that it will be powered by a new engine called the iForce Max. Speculation is that the base engine will be the same 409 hp twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 that was recently introduced in the new Land Cruiser that will be sold in other markets. Toyota's executive V.P. of U.S. sales, Bob Carter, also said that an even more powerful option will be offered and that Toyota is "in it to win it" in the full-size pickup segment.

          <h3 class='post-header'>FBI agent acknowledges in court filing that Trump backers discussed 'revolution' before Jan. 6</h3>
          <p class='post-number-3'>WASHINGTON — The FBI director and other senior officials have consistently downplayed the intelligence value of social media posts by Trump supporters prior to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, suggesting the bureau had no "actionable" warning that the Capitol would be targeted by a mob.

But according to a document entered into court records last week, an FBI agent acknowledged in a February investigative report that angry Trump supporters were talking openly in the days before the riot about bringing guns to the Capitol to start a "revolution."

"A review of open source and social media posts leading up to and during the event indicates that individuals participating on the 'Stop the Steal,' rally were angered about the results of the 2020 presidential election and felt that Joseph Biden had unlawfully been declared 'President-Elect,'" said the report by FBI Special Agent Patricia Norden. "Users in multiple online groups and platforms discussed traveling to the Capitol armed or making plans to start a 'revolution' on that day."

Norden cited the posts as part of the FBI's justification for opening an investigation into former NYPD officer Thomas Webster, who was indicted in March on seven counts after he admitted attacking a Capitol Police officer on Jan. 6. Webster, who has pleaded not guilty, says he was struck first; a federal prosecutor said Webster displayed "pure rage" befitting a "junkyard dog." Video of the alleged assault was released Thursday.

Norden’s report didn’t accuse Webster of being involved in the social media agitation.

The FBI document doesn't say whether the FBI's review of social media posts was conducted before or after Jan. 6. The language in the document, however, contrasts with how FBI Director Christopher Wray has talked about what experts say was a vast trove of open source intelligence, beginning in December, pointing to potential violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, the day Congress was to count the electoral votes showing Biden's victory.

"To my knowledge, sir, we did not have actionable intelligence that indicated that hundreds of people were going to breach the Capitol or storm the Capitol," Wray told Rep. Ro Khanna, D.-Calif., at a hearing of the House Oversight Committee.

But Wray did not explain exactly what the FBI did know, and why the bureau didn't do more, including publishing an intelligence bulletin, in response to thousands of social media posts threatening violence in the weeks before Jan. 6.</p>

          <h3 class='post-header'>Nicaraguan police arrest fifth presidential hopeful</h3>
          <p class='post-number-6'>He formed part of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), which seized power after ousting Somoza in 1979. He served one term as president in the 1980s but was defeated in the 1990 election by Violeta Chamorro, whose daughter Cristiana is one of the presidential hopefuls now under arrest. After rebranding himself as a Christian socialist, he won elections in 2006, 2011 and 2016 and is expected to stand again in the upcoming election in November. 'Treason' law in action Cristiana Chamorro is accused of money laundering, which she denies. The others who have been detained are accused of plotting against Nicaragua's sovereignty and independence and of organising terrorist acts with financial help from foreign powers. They have been held under a controversial treason law passed in December by Nicaragua's National Assembly, which is dominated by government allies. Under the law, the government has the power to ban candidates from running for office if they are deemed to be traitors to Nicaragua. Anyone designated a traitor can be sent to prison for up to 15 years. The government says the law aims to protect "the independence, the sovereignty and self-determination" of Nicaragua. It says the country is under threat from imperialist powers in the US and "coup-mongers" within Nicaragua who are determined to overthrow President Ortega. But critics say that with November's scheduled presidential poll approaching, Mr Ortega is using the law to target anyone who may stand against him. Growing dissent Opposition to Mr Ortega has been growing in recent years. In 2018, mass anti-government protests swept through the country but were met with a violent police response. Hundreds were killed and thousands were injured in the clashes between the protesters on the one hand, and security forces and pro-government militia on the other. After many of those who had led the demonstrations were arrested, the protests eventually fizzled out later that year. Mr Ortega rejected calls made at the time for elections to be brought forward and continued to serve his term. But the wave of arrests has led to condemnation both within Nicaragua and abroad. Regional body the Organization of American States has demanded that all the presidential hopefuls and political prisoners be released. The criticism has had little effect on President Ortega and his wife, Vice-President Rosario Murillo. Ms Murillo said on Tuesday that "the law is tough, but it's the law" and called those arrested "usurpers". Police in Nicaragua have detained another potential candidate for the presidency in the latest crackdown on opposition figures. Journalist Miguel Mora was detained under Nicaragua's controversial "treason" law. He is the fifth presidential hopeful to be arrested in the past three weeks. The wave of detentions comes five months before elections in which President Daniel Ortega is expected to run for a fourth consecutive term. Why speaking out in Nicaragua is getting tough Nicaragua opposition figure put under house arrest Police said that they had arrested Mr Mora, a former director of opposition TV channel 100% Noticias, for "inciting foreign interference in internal affairs and requesting military intervention". Since 2 June, five presidential hopefuls have been arrested. They are: Miguel Mora, 57, opposition journalist Félix Maradiaga, 44, academic and political activist Juan Sebastián Chamorro, 52, economist Cristiana Chamorro, 67, daughter of ex-President Violeta Chamorro Arturo Cruz, 67, former ambassador As well as the potential presidential candidates, police have also detained a dozen senior opposition figures. They include former comrades-in-arms of Mr Ortega from his days as a Sandinista rebel, who later turned into critics of the president. Mr Ortega has been a dominant figure in Nicaraguan politics for decades and played a key role in the armed struggle against dictator Anastasio Somoza, whose family had ruled the country since 1936.

          <h3 class='post-header'>The empty hotel rooms of Minneapolis</h3>
          <p class='post-number-7'>Nick Halter Mon, June 21, 2021, 1:20 PM Data: STR/Greater MSP; Chart: Danielle Alberti/Axios Hotel rooms in downtown Minneapolis are still very empty, even as other cities enjoy a rebound in tourism. State of play: Downtown's tourism struggles are a big reason why the overall Twin Cities metro has been one of the worst performing large hotel markets in the country. The Twin Cities had a 42.5% occupancy rate in April and a 43.5% occupancy in May, which ranked 24th and 25th of the 25 largest markets, according to global hospitality benchmarking firm STR. Downtown Minneapolis' occupancy was 22% in April and 24% in May, according to STR. Meanwhile, St. Paul's occupancy was 45% and 48% those months. Why it matters: Tourism brings money to restaurants, retailers and other businesses in the city. And the city uses hotel tax revenue to pay off debt on U.S. Bank Stadium, Target Center and the Minneapolis Convention Center. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Between the lines: While the metro has faced many of the same challenges others have during the pandemic, the state's tighter COVID restrictions and the Derek Chauvin trial have kept tourists and most business travelers away. Yes, but: Public safety, both real and perceived, is also a factor, said Ben Wogsland, director of public affairs for the trade group Hospitality Minnesota. Some hotel operators are having a hard time getting employees to work downtown, he said. Threat level: A May survey of Minnesota hotel and motel operators found that 57% said they would be insolvent within a year under current conditions. What to watch: In a letter to Mayor Jacob Frey, Hospitality Minnesota CEO Liz Rammer asked the city to use federal relief money for direct grants to hotel operators. The organization cited a $30 million Washington, D.C. program that gave direct payments to operators. Frey has proposed $500,000 to Meet Minneapolis, the city's convention and visitors bureau, for incentives to attract conventions and another $500,000 boost for a marketing campaign. Of note: After the murder of George Floyd, Meet Minneapolis called off marketing campaigns, but they're now ramping things up, said CEO Melvin Tennant. "The room nights on the books for 2022 are actually outpacing room nights on the books for the same time in 2019," he said. Like this article?
